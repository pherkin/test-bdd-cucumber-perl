=head1 NAME

pherkin - Execute tests written using Test::BDD::Cucumber

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 pherkin
 pherkin some/path/features/

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<pherkin> accepts a single argument of a directory name, defaulting to
C<./features/> if none is specified. This directory is searched for feature
files (any file matching C<*.feature>) and step definition files (any file
matching C<*_steps.pl>). The step definitions are loaded, and then the features
executed.

Steps that pass are printed in green, those that fail in red, and those for
which there is no step definition - or that are skipped as the result of a
previous failure - as yellow.

C<pherkin> will exit with a non-zero status if (and only if) the overall result
is considered to be failing.

=head1 OPTIONS

 -l, --lib   Add 'lib' to @INC
 -b, --blib  Add 'blib/lib' and 'blib/arch' to @INC
 -I [dir]    Add given directory to @INC
