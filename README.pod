Test::BDD::Cucumber - Feature-complete Cucumber-style testing in Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A sane and complete Cucumber implementation in Perl

Behaviour of this module is similar to that, but sometimes different from
the I<real> Cucumber, the plan is to move use the same parser and behaviour
L<See the logged issue|https://github.com/pjlsergeant/test-bdd-cucumber-perl/issues/73>.

=head1 QUICK LINKS

L<Cucumber on Perl on MetaCPAN|https://metacpan.org/release/Test-BDD-Cucumber>

=head1 NEXT STEPS

If you are B<completely new to Cucumber>, you'd get a pretty overview from
reading our short and crunchy L<Tutorial|Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Tutorial>.

If you B<already understand Cucumber>, and just want to get started then you
should read the L<Step-writing quick-start
guide|Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Steps>, the documentation for our
command-line tool L<App::pherkin>, and L<How to integrate with
Test::Builder|Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Integration>.

If you B<want to extend or integrated Test::BDD::Cucumber> then you'd probably
be more interested in our L<Architecture
overview|Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Architecture>.

=head1 TEN SECOND GUIDE TO USING THIS IN YOUR CI ENVIRONMENT

Don't use the command-line tool, L<App::pherkin>, for integration in your
CI environment. Instead, look at the L<How to integrate with
Test::Builder|Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Integration> document.
