=head1 NAME

Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Result - Encapsulates a result state

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Encapsulation of result state - whether that's for a step, scenario, or feature

enum 'StepStatus', [qw( passing failing pending undefined )];

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 result

Enum of: C<passing>, C<failing>, C<pending> or C<undefined>. C<pending> is used
if there was any TODO output from a test, and C<undefined> for a test that
wasn't run, either due to no matching step, or because a previous step failed.

=cut

has 'result' => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'StepStatus', required => 1 );

=head2 output

The underlying test-output that contributed to a result.

=cut

has 'output' => ( is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', required => 1 );

=head1 METHODS

=head2 from_children

Collates the Result objects you pass in, and returns one that encompasses all
of them.

As they may be varied, it runs through them in order of C<failing>,
C<undefined>, C<pending> and C<passing> - the first it finds is the overall
result. The empty set passes.
