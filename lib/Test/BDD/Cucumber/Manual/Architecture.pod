Test::BDD::Cucumber::Manual::Architecture - Structural Overview

=head1 INTRODUCTION

This short document exists to give you an idea how the different components of
this distribution fit together.

=head1 MODELS

The core of a Cucumber-based test suite are the feature files and the step
definitions files. By convention, these are saved under C</features/> and
C</features/step_definitions/> respectively.

The feature files are encapsulated by the classes in
C<Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model>.

=head1 EXECUTOR

We build up a L<Test::BDD::Executor> object, in to which we load the step
definitions. We then pass this in a L<Test::BDD::Model::Feature> object, along
with a L<Test::BDD::Model::Harness> object, which controls interaction with
the outside world.
