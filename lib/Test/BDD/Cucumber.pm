=head1 NAME

Test::BDD::Cucumber - Feature-complete Cucumber-style testing in Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS


   # Driving tests using the 'pherkin' binary that comes with the distribution
   $ pherkin -l -b t/

   # Or choose a subset of tests to be run by selecting all scenarios tagged 'slow'
   $ pherkin -l -b --tags @slow t/

   # Or all those /not/ tagged 'slow'
   $ pherkin -l -b --tags ~@slow

   # Fail on missing steps (by default prints as orange output and succeeds tests)
   $ pherkin -l -b --strict t/


   # Driving tests using 'prove' integration
   $ prove --source Feature --ext=.feature examples/

   # Driving parallel tests using 'prove'
   $ prove -r --source Feature -j 9 --ext=.feature t/


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Cucumber for Perl, integrated with L<Test2>, L<Test::More> and L<prove>.

The implementation supports the following Gherkin keywords in feature files:
C<Feature>, C<Scenario>, C<Scenario Outline>, C<Examples>, C<Given>, C<When>,
C<Then>, C<And> and C<But>. Additionally, C<Scenario> can be used as a synonym
for C<Scenario Outline> (with C<Examples>). This best maps to
L<Gherkin version 6.0.13|https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/blob/master/gherkin/CHANGELOG.md#6013---2018-09-25>,
but without support for its new C<Rule> and C<Example> keywords.

This implementation supports the same languages as Gherkin 15.0.0 - that is, it
supports exactly the same translated keywords.

Behaviour of this module is similar to that, but sometimes different from
the I<real> Cucumber, the plan is to move use the same parser and behaviour.

For current bugs, check the issue tracer at GitHub:

One thing need specific mentioning:

=over 4

=item * Due to the use of its own parser, differences probably exist
in the interpretation of feature files when comparing to Cucumber.

Also L<see the issue|https://github.com/pherkin/test-bdd-cucumber-perl/issues/73> for
