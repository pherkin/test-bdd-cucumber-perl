=head1 NAME

App::pherkin - Run Cucumber tests from the command line

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 pherkin
 pherkin some/path/features/

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<pherkin> will search the directory specified (or C<./features/>) for
feature files (any file matching C<*.feature>) and step definition files (any
file matching C<*_steps.pl>), loading the step definitions and then executing
the features.

Steps that pass will be printed in green, those that fail in red, and those
for which there is no step definition as yellow (for TODO).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 run

The C<App::pherkin> class, which is what the C<pherkin> command uses, makes
use of the C<run()> method, which accepts currently a single path as a string,
or nothing.

Returns a L<Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Result> object for all steps run.
