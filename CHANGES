0.82  [to be released]
    [Added]
       - Environment variable expansion in configuration profiles; use
         ${ENVVAR} anywhere in a 'pherkin.yaml' file to substitude the
         value from the environment. Use $${ENVVAR} to include the
         exact value '${ENVVAR}.
0.81  2021-07-18
    [Fixed]
       - Remove cruft from released archive (by expanding .gitignore)
0.80  2021-07-18
    [Fixed]
       - UTF-8 in test output double encoded
       - Tutorial example references `use_ok`, which does not exist in
         Test2::Bundle::More
       - Step redispatching with step data now work (with documentation)
0.79  2021-03-19
    [Fixed]
       - Fix parallel testing support in the `prove` plugin (prove '-j' support)
0.78  2021-03-19
    [Changed]
       - Files with DOS line endings (\r\n) no longer leave \r at the
         end of the line on Unix (\n line-ending systems)
       - Stop warning about mixed comments being disallowed after consulting
         the Cucumber project through their Slack channel
       - Moved CI to GitHub Actions, because TravisCI minutes ran out
    [Fixed]
       - Fix passing UTF-8 data from sub-process spawned by `prove` plugin
       - Fix formatting UTF-8 TAP output collected during step execution
0.77  2021-02-10
    [Added]
       - New option `--version` for `pherkin`
    [Changed]
       - Even more compact storage of language definitions
    [Fixed]
       - With `prove`, no location details are reported (as they are with
         regular Test::More tests), unless run in verbose mode which includes
         all non-failing output too (gh #176)
       - Require YAML v1.15 to fix failures seen on cpantesters
       - No exit status reported for tests run by the `prove` integration
0.76  2021-02-07
    [Added]
       - Mention the `--strict` option for `pherkin` in SYNOPSIS
       - Added deprecation warning to 'data' accessor in
         Test::BDD::Cucumber::Model::Scenario
    [Fixed]
       - Warnings when processing empty feature files or files without
         a text after the `Feature:` keyword
       - Feature and scenario descriptions missing space on concatenated lines
       - Location of failed test in TAP output now points to the failed step,
         instead of somewhere inside `TAP::Harness`
    [Changed]
       - Scenarios defined by a scenario outline (`Examples:`) are now
         independent as in Cucumber; before, failure of a scenario in an
         outline would cancel all subsequent steps *and* scenarios -- now
         only steps are cancelled (skipped), but subsequent scenarios are
         run (gh #123)
       - Descriptions of tests no longer contain prefixed 'In '
       - Dependency YAML::Syck switched to YAML (which wraps YAML::XS or
         YAML::PP, whichever is available); YAML has 3x more dependencies
         on CPAN, increasing chances of prior availability
       - Language definitions now stored as Perl instead of JSON for
         compactness and load speed
    [Removed]
       - Dependencies on Clone, List::MoreUtils, Number::Range
0.75  2020-12-28
    [Fixed]
       - Passing multiple tags arguments to prove correctly intersects
         the sets;
         e.g. '--feature-option tags=@wip --feature-option tags=@daily' now
         correctly runs stricttly the scenarios matching both @wip and @daily
       - Tutorial.pod incorrectly stated --tags=@tag1,~@tag2 runs scenarios
         tagged '@tag1' except those tagged '@tag2': it runs all tagged
         '@tag1' and all *not* tagged '@tag2'.
       - Clarified difference between step definitions, step models and step
         execution contexts
    [Added]
       - Explanation in 'pherkin' how to pass tag patterns
       - Expanded explanation in Tuturial.pod how to pass tag patterns
0.74  2020-12-12
    [Fixed]

    [Added]
      - Allow Example variables to be used in Scenario Outline title

        where in fact the sets are equal (with tests)
0.69  2020-04-19
    [Fixed]
      - Multiple examples would always report incompatible column sets
      - Multiple examples trigger parser error due to accessing a
        deprecated scenario attribute
0.68  2020-04-18
    [Added]
      - New --strict option for `pherkin` which causes an exit value of 1
        when there are 'pending' or 'missing' steps
    [Fixed]
      - Too much code was running with $/ bound to `undef` when parsing
        Gherkin from file
      - NAME section missing in two modules causing Dist::Zilla to fail
        insertion of VERSION section
    [Changed]
      - Some improved error messages
0.67  2019-09-26
    [Changed]
      - Add package statement to step files of core feature tests
      - Move Executor from Test2::API::context() to Test2::Bundle::More
        (for pass, fail and done_testing) to fix seemingly random failures.

    [Added]
      - Full support for package declarations in step files
0.66  2019-09-22
    [Fixed]

    - Fix regression in 0.61 with `prove` plugin printing TAP on STDOUT
0.61  2019-09-07

    - Cleaned up release procedure: 0.58 and 0.59 were sloppy, including
